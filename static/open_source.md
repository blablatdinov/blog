## Own projects:

[deltaver](https://github.com/blablatdinov/deltaver) - python project designed to calculate the lag or delay in dependencies in terms of days.

[ondivi](https://github.com/blablatdinov/ondivi) - python script filtering coding violations, identified by static analysis, only for changed lines in a Git repo.

[pyeo](https://github.com/blablatdinov/pyeo) - advanced static analysis tool tailored specifically to enforce the principles advocated by Elegant Objects ([elegantobjects.org](https://elegantobjects.org)) in Python projects. It serves as a quality control instrument to ensure that your Python code adheres to the core tenets of elegance, simplicity, and maintainability.

[clup](https://github.com/blablatdinov/clup) - update your CHANGELOG.md with new version entries and release dates.

[anki-action](https://github.com/blablatdinov/anki-action) - This GitHub Action allows you to convert Markdown files into Anki flashcards. You can easily create Anki decks from your markdown content using this automated workflow.

[flake8-final](https://github.com/blablatdinov/flake8-final) - flake8 plugin for check and inheritance of implementations. Inheritance is bad and that composition over inheritance is a good idea

[flake8-override](https://github.com/blablatdinov/flake8-override) - Flake8 plugin designed to enforce a coding standard where every method in a class must have the "typing.override" decorator. This ensures that all public methods implement their counterparts from an interface, promoting better design practices

[flake8-no-json](https://github.com/blablatdinov/flake8-no-json) - This is a Flake8 plugin that prevents the use of the standard json package in Python code. The intent is to enforce the use of an alternative JSON handling library, such as ujson, orjson, or any other specified by your project guidelines.

[revive-code-bot](https://github.com/blablatdinov/revive-code-bot) - Github bot is an automated tool designed to help maintain repositories by identifying and notifying about stagnant code files that might require review. It assists in keeping your projects up-to-date and promotes regular code reviews to ensure code quality.
