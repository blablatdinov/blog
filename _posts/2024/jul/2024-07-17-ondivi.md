I'm very like different linters, static analyzers, type checkers in general
tools which improve code quality. But in some projects we can't install and
start using it because code base very large and for applying all rules from
linter owners must pay thouthands man-hours work

<!--more-->

## Problem

Let's see integration [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) in legacy project:

```
pip install ruff
```

Try check source code. Ruff disable many rules by default, but I'm include "ALL"
and disable unnessary manually.
[Example](https://github.com/blablatdinov/ondivi/blob/master/pyproject.toml#L57-L105) of my ruff configuration.

```
ruff check src --select=ALL
```

After this command we see hundreds errors, report about problems to manager and he 
say: "We hasn't time to fix it right now" and you push code quality to the back of the drawer.
Project continue degradate

Many users of ruff, flake8 and other search methods for create baseline and fix only
new violations.

 - [ruff discussion](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1149)
 - [mypy baseline tool](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/mypy-baseline)
 - [flakeheaven](https://github.com/flakehell/flakehell)
 - [flakehell](https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven)

## Solution

I suggest use [ondivi](https://github.com/blablatdinov/ondivi), which not dependency internal
realization of code quality tool. It read stdout of your linter and filter out messages, which
not matches in `git diff` output.

```
git checkout -b new-branch
# make changes
ruff check src --select=ALL | ondivi
```

By default `ondivi` check difference with `master` branch but you can set baseline with `--baseline` param:

```
ruff check src --select=ALL | ondivi --baseline=master
# or select commit
ruff check src --select=ALL | ondivi --baseline=56faa56
```

flakeheaven and flakehell are not supported because they rely on internal flake8 API,
which can lead to compatibility issues as flake8 evolves.
In contrast, ondivi uses only the text output of violations and the state of Git repository,
making it more robust and easier to maintain.
